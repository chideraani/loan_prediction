## Requirements
  - Python 3
  - Jupyter Notebook

## How to use
  - Download the notebook and the dataset and run the codes

## Output
  - The best model proved to the Logistic Regression Classifier with 81.46% accuracy.
  - Visualizations for this project was done using Tableau and can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/chidera1611#!/vizhome/LoanPredictionProject/gender)

## Extending this...
  - Try to carry out an extensive EDA and maybe create more features.
  - Try to increase the model accuracy by hyperparameter tuning or other methods.
